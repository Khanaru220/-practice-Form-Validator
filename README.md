## What I have tried this time?

- first time use **Polacode** to capture code screen
- first **side Project** to test my knowledge about JS logic (harder than I thought)
- first time use digital mindmap to brainstorm and plan how I solve the problem (messy than I believed)
- Although the code I try first time look awful. But it has meaning with comment and note I make (I like that messy when look back). The good results I get are the questions I looked for while struggle find multiple ways to barely solve problems. Eventually, I received those answer from teacher.
- this time I prepare screenshot, material, video editing, music more quickly than before.
